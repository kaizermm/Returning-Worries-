# Returning-Worries-
In this project, I served as a store analyst for SuperStore, dedicating a significant amount of time to assisting them in comprehending the underlying reasons behind customer returns and devising strategies to mitigate the volume of returned orders.
The store dataset return rate can be influenced by many factors: category, ship mode, month, states, and customers,etc.
