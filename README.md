## Aim of this project
Based on the dataset, various factors such as category, ship mode, month, states, and customers can influence the return rate in the Superstore dataset. The purpose of this dashboard is to analyze the Superstore.xls dataset and provide valuable insights into the return rate. As assigned by the CEO, my task is to identify the top five most significant factors that can impact returns. These include determining the month with the highest return rate, identifying the category and ship mode that contribute the most to returns, identifying the customer with the highest return rate, and pinpointing the state with the highest return rate. By answering these questions, we aim to better understand the key factors influencing returns and provide actionable solutions for the Superstore to reduce return rates and enhance overall performance.
 
 After talking to CEO, I've drawn up brief technical requirements:
- Business goal: analyze return rate on for Superstore
- How often the dashboard will be used: at least once a day

- Target dashboard user: As a data analyst at the Superstore, I worked closely with the CEO to analyze the factors behind customer order returns and develop strategies to minimize the return volume.

- Dashboard data content:
    - Return rate by month
    - Return rate by customer
    - The visualization showcases the correlation between states and return rates.
    - Return rate by category and ship-mode
