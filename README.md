## Aim of this project
Based on the dataset, various factors such as category, ship mode, month, states, and customers can influence the return rate in the Superstore dataset. The purpose of this dashboard is to analyze the Superstore.xls dataset and provide valuable insights into the return rate. As assigned by the CEO, my task is to identify the top five most significant factors that can impact returns. These include determining the month with the highest return rate, identifying the category and ship mode that contribute the most to returns, identifying the customer with the highest return rate, and pinpointing the state with the highest return rate. By answering these questions, we aim to better understand the key factors influencing returns and provide actionable solutions for the Superstore to reduce return rates and enhance overall performance.
 ## Target audience
 The target audience for this project includes:
1. CEO: The objective is to identify the key factors contributing to a high return rate and develop effective policies to mitigate the issue.
2.	Store manager: The purpose of this initiative is to empower store managers with valuable insights derived from the CEO's policies.
3.	Store supervisor: The objective is to utilize the insights gained from the analysis to ensure that the workers align their practices with the CEO's guidelines.
